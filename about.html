                                    We all know the pandemic that is ongoing over the world literally in every country, the Covid-19 pandemic. 
									Almost all the businesses and industries are facing numerous operational and financial problems these days due to Covid-19. 
									People largely stay at home due to the needs of social distancing and allow working remotely. Other than that, it has given tech-savvy 
									people to explore ways of getting into organizational technical systems using different kinds of flaws available in the digital systems. 
									Healthcare field is one of the major fields that is affected due to the Covid-19 both in terms of operational and cyber security. 
									The cyber attacks to healthcare systems are common. In this challenge, a healthcare system which mainly focuses on a Covid-19 vaccination 
									program is provided for the users to find the flags, attack, and get access to the system to reveal some sensitive and extremely interesting 
									information of the hosting hospital.
                                </p>

                                    The Outbreak challenge can be played literary by anyone who is interested in cyber security and related areas. 
									However, this would mainly benefit the IT staff working in the hospitals to gain an understanding about the 
									possible ways of the healthcare systems can get exploited and attacked by the outsiders.  In fact, anyone who is 
									interesting in getting a future cyber security or IT job in a hospital, this would be a great opportunity for them 
									to understand how the hospital systems work!
